# HyperBlocks — Library Bootstrap

This document covers how HyperBlocks initializes itself, how the version-resolution system works, and how to configure it correctly when vendored inside another plugin or theme.

---

## How bootstrap works

HyperBlocks uses the same candidate-election bootstrap pattern as HyperFields. The goal is to allow multiple copies of HyperBlocks to coexist (e.g. a theme and a plugin both require it) while ensuring only one instance — the highest-version one — actually initializes.

**Sequence**:

1. Each copy of `bootstrap.php` is included by Composer via `autoload.files`.
2. Each inclusion registers the copy as a candidate in `$GLOBALS['hyperblocks_api_candidates']` with its version and path.
3. After all plugins/theme are loaded, `after_setup_theme` (priority 0) fires `hyperblocks_select_and_load_latest()`.
4. The candidate with the highest version wins and calls `hyperblocks_run_initialization_logic()`.
5. `hyperblocks_run_initialization_logic()` defines all `HYPERBLOCKS_*` constants and calls `WordPress\Bootstrap::init()`.
6. Subsequent candidates are silently skipped (guarded by `HYPERBLOCKS_INSTANCE_LOADED`).

HyperBlocks also triggers HyperFields initialization in the same `bootstrap.php` if the HyperFields standalone plugin is not already active. This means requiring `estebanforge/hyperblocks` in your Composer dependencies is the only step needed — you do not need to require or bootstrap HyperFields separately.

## Host plugins using the Jetpack Autoloader

If your host plugin uses [`automattic/jetpack-autoloader`](https://packagist.org/packages/automattic/jetpack-autoloader)
instead of Composer's stock autoloader, **Composer autoload `files` entries are
not executed.** The Jetpack Autoloader maps classes for lazy loading but
deliberately skips the `files` auto-includes that Composer would normally run.

HyperBlocks' `bootstrap.php` is registered as an autoload file. It is what
registers the library as a candidate and hooks `after_setup_theme` to run the
version election. When it never executes:

- `HYPERBLOCKS_PLUGIN_URL` is never defined.
- `WordPress\Bootstrap::init()` never runs — no block registration, no REST
  routes, no editor assets.
- Fluent blocks never reach the Registry; `block.json` blocks may register via
  WP but the editor JS (`editor.js`) and preview endpoints are missing.

The classes are still autoloadable, so code that references them does not fatal,
but blocks are absent from the inserter and the editor experience is broken.

**Fix.** Explicitly require the bootstrap file and call the init function on
`plugins_loaded` (priority 0, before any host code that registers blocks):

```php
// my-plugin.php

add_action('plugins_loaded', static function (): void {
    $bootstrap = MY_PLUGIN_PATH . 'vendor/estebanforge/hyperblocks/bootstrap.php';
    if (!file_exists($bootstrap)) {
        return;
    }
    require_once $bootstrap;

    if (function_exists('hyperblocks_run_initialization_logic')) {
        hyperblocks_run_initialization_logic(
            $bootstrap,
            defined('MY_PLUGIN_VERSION') ? MY_PLUGIN_VERSION : '1.0.0',
        );
    }
}, 0);
```

HyperBlocks' init also triggers HyperFields' (HB requires HF transitively), so
this single call bootstraps both. Calling it directly skips the multi-instance
candidate election and runs init immediately. For a single-consumer plugin this
is correct and faster; the `HYPERBLOCKS_INSTANCE_LOADED` guard still prevents
double-init.

If your host plugin vendors HyperFields separately as well (not just
transitively through HyperBlocks), call `hyperfields_run_initialization_logic()`
too. Both calls are harmless thanks to the idempotency guards.

---

## Constants

After `hyperblocks_run_initialization_logic()` runs, these constants are defined:

| Constant | Description |
|---|---|
| `HYPERBLOCKS_VERSION` | Version string read from `composer.json`. |
| `HYPERBLOCKS_PATH` | Absolute path to the HyperBlocks root directory (trailing slash). |
| `HYPERBLOCKS_ABSPATH` | Alias of `HYPERBLOCKS_PATH`. |
| `HYPERBLOCKS_PLUGIN_FILE` | Absolute path to `bootstrap.php`. |
| `HYPERBLOCKS_PLUGIN_URL` | Public URL to the HyperBlocks root (trailing slash). |
| `HYPERBLOCKS_BOOTSTRAP_LOADED` | Set when `bootstrap.php` is first included. Prevents double-include. |
| `HYPERBLOCKS_INSTANCE_LOADED` | Set when initialization logic runs. Ensures single initialization. |
| `HYPERBLOCKS_LOADED_VERSION` | The version string of the instance that won election. |
| `HYPERBLOCKS_INSTANCE_LOADED_PATH` | Absolute path of the winning `bootstrap.php`. |

## Standard usage — flat vendor directory

The most common case: a plugin requires `estebanforge/hyperblocks` and loads its own Composer autoloader.

```
wp-content/plugins/my-plugin/
├── my-plugin.php
└── vendor/
    └── estebanforge/
        ├── hyperblocks/
        └── hyperfields/
```

```php
// my-plugin.php

$autoload = plugin_dir_path(__FILE__) . 'vendor/autoload.php';
if (file_exists($autoload)) {
    require_once $autoload;
}

// HyperBlocks bootstrap is included automatically via Composer autoload.files.
// No further initialization is required — blocks may be registered from init onwards.

add_action('init', function (): void {
    use HyperBlocks\Block\Block;
    use HyperBlocks\Block\Field;
    use HyperBlocks\Registry;

    Registry::getInstance()->registerFluentBlock(
        Block::make('My Block')
            ->setName('my-plugin/my-block')
            ->addFields([Field::make('text', 'heading', 'Heading')])
            ->setRenderTemplateFile('blocks/my-block.hb.php')
    );
});
```

## Usage inside a class (plugins_loaded pattern)

When your plugin defers setup to a bootstrap class, define constants at the top of the main plugin file so URL resolution works correctly even after `plugins_loaded` runs.

```php
// my-plugin.php

define('MY_PLUGIN_FILE', __FILE__);
define('MY_PLUGIN_DIR',  plugin_dir_path(__FILE__));
define('MY_PLUGIN_URL',  plugin_dir_url(__FILE__));

add_action('plugins_loaded', function (): void {
    require_once MY_PLUGIN_DIR . 'vendor/autoload.php';
    MyPlugin\Bootstrap::init();
});
```

```php
// src/Bootstrap.php

namespace MyPlugin;

class Bootstrap
{
    public static function init(): void
    {
        add_action('init', [self::class, 'registerBlocks']);
    }

    public static function registerBlocks(): void
    {
        \HyperBlocks\Config::registerBlockPath(MY_PLUGIN_DIR . 'blocks');
    }
}
```

---

## Monorepo / Bedrock / symlinked plugins

In setups where the plugins directory is outside the standard `wp-content/plugins` path, or where plugin directories are symlinks, `HYPERBLOCKS_PLUGIN_URL` is resolved via `plugins_url()` which uses WordPress' own plugin registration — not the filesystem path. This is reliable.

```
web/app/plugins/my-plugin/     ← WP registration (may be a symlink)
packages/my-plugin/
├── my-plugin.php
└── vendor/estebanforge/hyperblocks/
```

```php
// my-plugin.php — plugin_dir_url() resolves against WP's plugin registration, not the symlink target.

require_once plugin_dir_path(__FILE__) . 'vendor/autoload.php';

// bootstrap.php is included by autoload.files — nothing else needed.
```

---

## When HyperBlocks is used as a library nested inside a larger plugin

If your plugin itself ships as a Composer library required by another plugin (a chain like `my-core-plugin` → `estebanforge/hyperblocks`), the bootstrap chain still works. Each level's `bootstrap.php` registers its copy as a candidate. The version with the highest number wins.

The only thing to verify is that your autoloader is loaded before `after_setup_theme` (priority 0) fires. Because `plugins_loaded` fires before `after_setup_theme`, loading the autoloader on `plugins_loaded` is safe.

---

## Manually triggering initialization (edge cases)

In non-WordPress environments (WP-CLI scripts, testing without Brain Monkey) `add_action` may not exist. Guard your initialization:

```php
if (function_exists('add_action')) {
    require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
    // bootstrap.php is included by autoload.files
}
```

For PHPUnit tests, define `HYPERBLOCKS_TESTING_MODE` before loading the autoloader to bypass the direct-access guards in source files:

```php
// tests/bootstrap.php
define('ABSPATH', __DIR__ . '/../');
define('HYPERBLOCKS_TESTING_MODE', true);
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';
require_once __DIR__ . '/mocks/wp-mocks.php';
\HyperBlocks\Config::reset();
\HyperBlocks\Config::init();
```

## Relationship with HyperFields bootstrap

HyperBlocks' `bootstrap.php` includes HyperFields' `bootstrap.php` from the vendored path when it is not already loaded:

```
vendor/estebanforge/hyperblocks/bootstrap.php
  └── requires vendor/estebanforge/hyperfields/bootstrap.php
```

HyperFields' own guards (`HYPERFIELDS_BOOTSTRAP_LOADED`, `HYPERFIELDS_INSTANCE_LOADED`) prevent double-initialization. If the HyperFields standalone plugin is active, it registers its copy as a candidate first; HyperBlocks' vendored copy also registers — whichever version is higher wins and initializes. Both copies coexist safely.

If you are building a plugin that requires both HyperBlocks and HyperFields as direct Composer dependencies, requiring only `estebanforge/hyperblocks` is sufficient — HyperFields is pulled in transitively and bootstrapped automatically.

## Checking initialization state

```php
// Has the winning instance been selected and initialized?
if (defined('HYPERBLOCKS_INSTANCE_LOADED')) {
    // Safe to use HyperBlocks classes
}

// Which version won?
echo HYPERBLOCKS_LOADED_VERSION;

// Has bootstrap.php been included at least once?
if (defined('HYPERBLOCKS_BOOTSTRAP_LOADED')) {
    // autoloader is available
}
```
